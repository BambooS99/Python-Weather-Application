# Python-Weather-Application
This is a Python application written using the ktinker Python interface and can be run as an exe file which is included.
The purpose of this application is to determine the weather globally for any area using zip codes, city, state, etc.

This application also uses the Openweathermap API, which can be found at https://openweathermap.org/. Since it is the trial version which
is being used, the key for the API must be renewed every so often, which can be done by the user if desired (refer to line 29)

To use this software simply download all the files and keep them in the same folder/ directory. either .exe or .py file can be run by the
user.
